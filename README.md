PIXEL iOS DEVELOPER TEST APP
Mark Bonsor


INSTRUCTIONS

On running the app, a call will be made to the StackOverview Api to retrieve a list of the top 20 users. Once loaded, the profile images are downloaded from the server and displayed.

Tap the 'Follow' button to follow a user. A 'tick' will be displayed on the image. Tap 'Unfollow' to stop following a user. Your choices are saved to the local UserDefaults file.


DESIGN NOTES

The images are loaded by the addition of a 'download' extension to the UIImageView object.
